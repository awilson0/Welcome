# Welcome to the Haney Lab!

This repository is an attempt to compile the computational resources you may use as part of your work here.

## Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com) is a nice tool to communicate with other lab members. Important information (and sometimes less important) will be shared on [our team's slack](https://haneylab.slack.com), so do request access if it is not already done.


## WestGrid / Owncloud

[WestGrid](https://www.westgrid.ca) is a computational network that we use both for common storage (via OwnCloud) of presentations, protocols and so on, and for bioinformatics jobs.
We have a [detailed tutorial](WestGrid_Onboarding.md) to get onboard.



## Github Organization

[Github](https://github.com/) is a great resource to work on programming and scripting projects.
If you intend to collaborate on a programming project, or even analyse your data in a scripting language (`R`/`python`/...), 
you may want to create a repository within the [haneylab github organisation](https://github.com/haneylab/). 
*Send your github identifier to @qgeissmann to get access*.

## CAD/3D printing on onshape

[Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/) is a fine collaborative/cloud-based software for Computer Assisted Design. We use this tool mostly to build custom hardware.
To take part, make a free account and *send your identifier to [@qgeissmann](mailto:qgeissmann@gmail.com) to get access*.
Then, visit [our team page](https://cad.onshape.com/documents?nodeId=5bd0f69234165112c7da2201&resourceType=team).
