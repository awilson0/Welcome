# Welcome to the Haney Lab!

This repository is an attempt to compile the resources you may use as part of your work here.


## Github Organization

Github is a great resource to work on programming and scripting projects.
If you intend to collaborate on a programmming project, or even analyse your data in a scripting language (`R`/`python`/...), 
you may want to create a repository within the [haneylab github organisation](https://github.com/haneylab/). 
*Send your github identifier to @qgeissmann to get access*.

## CAD/3D printing on onshape

Onshape is a fine collaborative/cloud based software for Computer Assisted Design. We use this tool mostly to build custom hardware.
To take part, make a free account and *send your identifier to @qgeissmann to get access*.
